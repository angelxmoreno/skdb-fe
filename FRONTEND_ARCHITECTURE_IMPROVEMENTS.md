# Frontend Architecture & Implementation Improvements

This document outlines recommended improvements and considerations for the frontend implementation of the Serial Killer Wiki. The following sections detail enhancements in security, API abstraction, state management, UI components, and project structure before starting the implementation.

---

## 1. Authentication Handling & Security

### Secure JWT Storage
- **LocalStorage vs. Cookies:**  
  Storing JWTs in localStorage is simple but exposes you to XSS attacks. Consider using HTTP-only cookies for storing tokens if your API supports it.

- **Token Refresh Mechanism:**  
  With sliding expiration, ensure there’s a strategy for seamless token refreshing (e.g., intercepting 401 responses in Axios to attempt a token refresh).

- **Token Revocation:**  
  Design frontend logic to gracefully handle token revocation events (e.g., redirecting the user to the login page if their token is no longer valid).

### Login Flow
- Provide clear feedback on authentication status (e.g., loading spinners, error messages).
- Consider a dedicated authentication context or slice (using Zustand or TanStack Query’s cache) to manage user state, token handling, and token renewal.

## 2. API Abstraction & Error Handling

### Centralized API Service
- **API Wrapper:**  
  Create an abstraction layer (e.g., an `api.ts` module) that wraps Axios. This layer should automatically attach the JWT to headers, manage interceptors for error handling, and handle token refreshes.

- **Error Interceptors:**  
  Implement global error handling in Axios interceptors to catch errors (like 401/403) and propagate them to a central error handler.

### Type Safety
- Utilize TypeScript generics to strongly type API responses.
- Define shared interfaces for serial killer data, profiles, questions, and answers.

### Caching and Background Sync
- Leverage TanStack Query for caching server state.
- Plan for background refetching strategies, optimistic updates, and error retries to enhance the user experience.

## 3. State Management and Routing

### Global State Considerations
- Use Zustand for global state management (e.g., user data) and decide if transient state (like form data) should be handled locally within components.
- Clearly separate the state management of server state (handled by TanStack Query) and client state (handled by Zustand) to avoid duplication or conflicts.

### Routing Structure
- Define a clear routing hierarchy using TanStack Router that reflects both public (login, home) and protected (dashboard, CRUD operations) areas.
- Implement route guards for authentication-protected routes. Centralize this logic to redirect unauthenticated users or handle token invalidation.

---

## 4. Component Architecture & UI Considerations

### Modular Components
- **Reusability:**  
  Design UI components to be modular and reusable. Create generic list, detail, and form components that can be extended for serial killers, profiles, questions, and answers.

- **Error Boundaries:**  
  Use React’s error boundaries around major component sections to catch runtime errors and display friendly error messages.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Utilize Bootstrap’s responsive components and ReactBootstrap wrappers for consistent styling.

- **Loading States:**  
  Implement loading indicators or skeleton screens for data fetching components to improve perceived performance.

### Search and Filtering
- Design the UI for listing and searching serial killers with debounced search inputs, filters, pagination, and sorting.
- Ensure that UI interactions are reflected in API queries.

---

## 5. Project Structure & Development Workflow

### Project Organization
- **Directory Structure:**  
  Map out a clear directory structure with separate folders for components, hooks, contexts/stores, services/api, and types/interfaces.

- **Naming Conventions:**  
  Define naming conventions that scale as your project grows.

### Development Tools & Testing
- **Linting & Formatting:**  
  Integrate tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.

- **Testing:**  
  Set up unit tests (e.g., with Jest and React Testing Library) for critical functionalities like the authentication flow and API services.
  Consider end-to-end tests (e.g., using Cypress) to simulate user flows such as logging in or editing entries.

### Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes or heavy components using Vite’s capabilities.
- Monitor bundle size with tools (like Vite’s build analyzer) to ensure optimal performance.

## Summary

Before starting implementation, refining these areas can help prevent common pitfalls:

- **Security:**  
  Secure JWT handling, token refresh, and error scenarios.

- **API Layer:**  
  Centralized API calls with proper interceptors and type-safe responses.

- **State & Routing:**  
  Clear separation between server and client state with protected routes.

- **UI Components:**  
  Reusable, modular components with robust error handling and responsive design.

- **Project Structure:**  
  Maintainable directory organization and a solid development workflow with testing and performance monitoring.

Taking the time to plan these aspects now will save significant refactoring and debugging later on. This foundation will set you up for a successful implementation of the frontend for the Serial Killer Wiki API.
